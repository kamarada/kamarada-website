Linux Kamarada is a Brazilian [Linux] distribution that can be used on personal computers, be at home or at work, in private companies or government entities. It was made thinking on people who are starting to use computers and/or Linux, but it also appeal to more experienced users. Linux Kamarada comes with the essential software for any Linux installation and an easy to use, nice looking and modern desktop.

After a few months of development, this week the first **stable** version of Linux Kamarada has been released. That means that Linux Kamarada is **ready to use**. You can download it [here][download].

Why then the number 15.1, if this is the first version? Keep reading to understand.

    </div>
</div>

Linux Kamarada has not been created from scratch. Instead, it is based on a bigger distribution called [openSUSE Leap][leap-15.1], which provides a user-friendly desktop and a feature-rich server environment, as well as free software tools for software developers and system administrators. It is one of the most popular Linux distributions throughout the world, developed by the [openSUSE Project][opensuse] community, with the sponsor of [SUSE] and other companies.

A friend from university introduced me to openSUSE in 2012 and I have been using it ever since. There was only one distribution called openSUSE, which was then at version 12.1. From [late 2015][leap-42.1], openSUSE has been split into two distributions:

- **openSUSE Leap:** more stable, keeps the regular release cycle of the old but gold openSUSE (and other traditional distributions such as [Ubuntu], [Debian] and [Fedora]), but brings a new development process, it is currently at version 15.1 and new versions are released usually once a year; and
- **openSUSE Tumbleweed:** is a _rolling release_ version of openSUSE, that means it does not have different versions, but just the latest version, which always contains the latest software, Tumbleweed receives small and frequent updates whenever a software is updated, similar to distributions such as [Arch] and [Manjaro].

Leap is best suited for novice users and organizations, who tend to avoid frequent updates. Tumbleweed is preferred by enthusiastic users who want bleeding edge Linux.

As Linux Kamarada is a distribution designed for novice users, it is based on openSUSE Leap. The same version number (15.1) has been adopted to denote its alignment.

    </div>
</div>

The [GNOME] desktop is one of the most popular desktops among Linux users and distributions. It presents a simple, elegant and minimalist look, which helps you to focus and get things done. Designed with usability in mind, it's a fast and easy-to-use desktop that just works, with integrated applications that offer a consistent user experience.

One of the things I like the most on openSUSE — and one of the reasons I recommend it to anyone who asks me for a Linux distribution — is [YaST] (an acronym for "Yet another Setup Tool").

YaST is the installation and configuration tool for the openSUSE and the [SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE)][sle] distributions. Handy for beginners, it features a friendly graphical interface and gathers in one place all the administrative settings (those that affect all users), such as installing and removing programs, printers, users, date and time, etc.

Whether you want to write a school assignment, prepare a presentation or track household expenses using a spreadsheet, Linux Kamarada has the applications you need: [LibreOffice], which is a suite of office applications, and [PDFsam] (PDF Split and Merge), which allows you to manipulate [PDF] documents by performing actions such as splitting a document (either by the page numbers or by the file size in bytes), merging documents, rotating or extracting pages, etc.

LibreOffice is the successor to [OpenOffice].

A notable new feature of LibreOffice 6.3 that comes out-of-the-box on Linux Kamarada 15.1 is the new tabbed interface, which organizes icons in tabs on a single panel at the top of the screen, similar to later versions of [Microsoft Office][ms-office]. This interface is optional and is not enabled by default. To switch to the new interface, open any LibreOffice application, click the **View** menu, point to **User Interface** and choose **Tabbed**:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/02/libreoffice-new-interface-en.jpg" %}

You can also test all the interface options in that menu and choose the one you like best.

</div>

According to [StatCounter], a web traffic analysis website, [Google Chrome][chrome] is currently the most used web browser in the world, with 69% of market share among desktop users.

What perhaps many people don't know is that Chrome is based on a free browser called [Chromium]. Chrome cannot be distributed because it is proprietary software, but Chromium can and is available on the official openSUSE repository.

For those reasons, Chromium was chosen to be the default Linux Kamarada web browser.

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/02/chromium-en.jpg" caption="Chromium" %}

Of course, if you prefer, you can install and use any other browser that you like.

Linux Kamarada ships with apps that allow you to manage your contacts, schedule meetings, send and receive emails, organize your tasks and take notes. These apps are called **personal information managers** (PIM). They seamlessly integrate with GNOME online accounts. If you have a [Google] or [Microsoft] account, for example, you can set it up on GNOME and sync all your data with the cloud and other devices. That way, you can schedule an event on your computer and get notified by your smartphone when the time comes.

[VLC] is the default Linux Kamarada multimedia player. It is truly the "Swiss Army knife" of media players: VLC plays most multimedia files (e.g. [MP3] and [DivX]), optical media ([CD], [DVD], [Blu-ray]) and various streaming protocols. If there is any multimedia file that VLC cannot open, probably no other player can!

Unfortunately, proprietary codecs cannot be distributed. Therefore, the VLC package that comes pre-installed on Linux Kamarada supports only free multimedia formats (e.g. [Xvid]) and cannot play many files.

The tip is to download VLC from the [Packman] repository. It provides the `vlc-codecs` package, which contains all the codecs supported by VLC (including the proprietary ones):

```
# zypper ar -cfK -p 90 -n "Packman Repository" http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/packman/suse/openSUSE_Leap_15.1/ packman

openSUSE Leap is developed by the openSUSE community, but shares a common core with SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE), developed by the SUSE company. If you need commercial support, you can easily migrate from Leap to SLE. Every Linux Kamarada installation is also a Leap installation and therefore inherits those characteristics.

Besides that, take a look at the following features, which may interest organizations:

Linux Kamarada is offered in two editions: the Brazilian edition, in Portuguese, and the international edition, in English. Other languages ​​supported by openSUSE can be installed through YaST.

The Brazilian edition already comes with several settings that Brazilian users would need to adjust on a normal openSUSE installation: language, keyboard layout, time zone and even the Brazilian root CA [ICP-Brasil] certificates. In practice, this means that the web browser trusts Brazilian government websites and classifies connections as secure:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/02/icp-brasil.jpg" %}

It also means that Brazilian users of digital certificates have one less configuration to worry about on Linux Kamarada, which would be this:

- [How to install website certificates on Linux][how-to-install-certificates]

Just make sure to run the following command whenever you install another web browser or email client, so that it receives the ICP-Brasil certificates:

```
$ instalar-icpbrasil
```

## And it does not stop there...

I tried to enumerate the main features of Linux Kamarada. Other two features that occur to me now are the [HP Device Manager][hplip] and the [KolourPaint] painting program. But I'm going to stop here, since the text is already a little long...

That's it. If you want to know Linux Kamarada better, now it's up to you: download it and test it!

## Where can I get Linux Kamarada?

The [Download] page has been updated with the download link for the 15.1 Final release.

**Warning:** it is not recommended to use Linux Kamarada on servers, although it is possible. openSUSE Leap is better suited for that use case, because it offers a server configuration during installation, which is going to set up a server with just a small set of packages and a text mode interface (without a desktop).

## What should I do next?

When the download is complete, verify the integrity of the ISO image by calculating its checksum. Compare it with the checksum that appears on the [Download] page. They must match. If they don't, download the ISO image again.

If you are not in a hurry, it is recommended to also verify the authenticity of the ISO image.

The fingerprint of the Linux Kamarada Project public key is:

```
6b18 52e7 764f b302 b805 a4a0 a575 bcce 1737 8ecc
```

To import that key, run the following commands:

```
$ wget https://build.opensuse.org/projects/home:kamarada:15.1/public_key
$ gpg --import public_key
```

For more information on those verifications, read:

- [Verifying data integrity and authenticity using SHA-256 and GPG][how-to-verify-iso]

[how-to-verify-iso]:    {% post_url en/2018-11-08-verifying-data-integrity-and-authenticity-using-sha-256-and-gpg %}

Once the ISO image has been downloaded and those verifications have succeeded, you have 3 options:

## What if I already use openSUSE Leap?

You already use openSUSE Leap and want to turn it into Linux Kamarada? It's simple!

Just add the Linux Kamarada repository and install the **[patterns-kamarada-gnome]** package.

There are two different methods for doing that: from the graphical interface, using 1-Click Install, or from the terminal, using the **zypper** package manager — choose whichever method you prefer.

To install Linux Kamarada using 1-Click Install, click the following button:

<p class='text-center'><a class='btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary' href='/downloads/patterns-kamarada-gnome-en.ymp'><i class='fas fa-bolt'></i> 1-Click Install</a></p>

To install Linux Kamarada using the terminal, first add its repository:

```
# zypper addrepo -f -K -n "Linux Kamarada" https://osdn.mirror.constant.com/storage/g/k/ka/kamarada/15.1/openSUSE_Leap_15.1/ kamarada
```

The Linux Kamarada repository is gently hosted by [OSDN], which replicates the repository contents on some mirror servers around the world. I picked a mirror at random to write the above command and 1-Click Install. You may want to take a look at the list of [Linux Kamarada mirrors][kamarada-mirrors] and choose a mirror closer to you.

Then, install the **patterns-kamarada-gnome** package:

```
# zypper in patterns-kamarada-gnome
```

If you already use the GNOME desktop, probably you will need to download just a few packages. If you use another desktop, the download size will be larger.

When the installation is finished, if you create a new user, you will notice that they will receive the Linux Kamarada default settings (such as theme, wallpaper, etc.). Existing users can continue to use their customizations or adjust the system appearance (for instance, using the **Tweaks** and **Settings** apps).

## Where can I get help?

The [Help] page suggests some places where you can get help with Linux Kamarada and openSUSE.

The main support channel for users is the [Google group for Linux Kamarada][google-group], which can be accessed from a web browser or used similar to a mailing list.

[help]:         /en/help
[google-group]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/linuxkamarada-ww

## Where can I get the source code?

Like any free software project, Linux Kamarada makes its source code available to anyone who wants to study it, adapt it, or contribute to the project.

Linux Kamarada development takes place at [GitHub] and [Open Build Service][obs]. There you can get the source codes of the packages developed specifically for this project (even [the source code of this web site][kamarada-website] you read is available).

Source codes of packages inherited from openSUSE can be retrieved directly from that distribution. If you need help doing this, get in touch, I can help.

## A little about the project

The Linux Kamarada Project was born from my desire to show people "Linux as I see it": an operating system suitable for everyday use at home and at work. So I started writing and sharing my experience as a Linux user. But I always wanted to create a Linux distribution gathering the programs I use, recommend and believe are the best. Finally it's not just a wish anymore: now it becomes something concrete.

"If a friend of mine asked me to format his computer and install Linux, how would I set it up?" Thinking that way, I developed the Kamarada Linux distribution including the software and customizations that I myself use at home and at work. Actually, not all the programs I use were included (that would produce a Linux distribution focused on IT professionals), but the ones I use and believe would be interesting to a lot of people. I only included in the distribution programs that I know. I even wrote about some of them here on the blog.

The release of Linux Kamarada 15.1 is not an ending point, but a starting poing: over time, as I discover new interesting features, I can add them to the distribution, or replace or remove programs as they become obsolete.

The name Linux Kamarada refers to the Portuguese word _[camarada]_, which means: buddy, pal, brother.

The Linux mascot is a penguin called [Tux]. The Kamarada mascot is a winking Tux:

{% include image.html src="/files/2019/09/tux-evolution.png" caption='Tux "evolution": original mascot by [Larry Ewing](https://isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/) in 1996, a GIF bitmap image made in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/); then a stylized version, this time an SVG vector image; and finally the Tux Kamarada.' %}

The letter C has been replaced with the letter K to refer to the [KDE] desktop, just as many KDE applications have their names beginning with the letter K, such as [Konsole] or [Kleopatra]. When I started using openSUSE, I was a KDE user. As time passed, I've got really upset with KDE because it seemed to reinvent the wheel from time to time but bugs were constant. So I moved to the GNOME desktop, which I consider more stable, and have been using it ever since. The Linux Kamarada Project already existed then and I decided to keep its name.

## A little about me

The Linux Kamarada Project is made up of a one-person team. Actually, I'm solely responsible for maintaining this project both as a blog and a Linux distribution, but in both cases I use and inherit a lot of free software made by the bigger openSUSE distribution and by many people around the world. The saying goes "No human being is an island".

My name is Antônio Vinícius (people call me by one name or the other). I was born in 1992 in [Aracaju], Brazil and received the name of [the saint of my day][anthony]. I am graduated as both computer technician and computer scientist. Currently I live in Florianópolis, Brazil and work as a systems analyst at [TJSC]. I have been using Linux for 12 years (since 2007). I am an enthusiastic user of Linux and free software in general. I'm a curious person always looking for new technologies and knowledge, which I share here on the Linux Kamarada blog and on my other [personal blog][vinyanalista] (in Portuguese only).
