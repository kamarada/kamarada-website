title: 'Tumbleweed needs a workaround to boot on the Raspberry Pi 4'
---

[openSUSE Tumbleweed][leap-vs-tumbleweed] works well on the [Raspberry Pi 4][rpi4b] (and also on the brand new [Raspberry Pi 400][raspberry-pi-400]), although [hardware support for it is still being developed][rpi4b-opensuse], so a few features such as Bluetooth and sound still don't work.&nbsp;

But recent Tumbleweed images for the Raspberry Pi 4 don't boot. The system keeps repeatedly saying: `Waiting for PHY auto negotiation to complete... TIMEOUT !`

{% include image.html src='/files/2020/12/rpi4b-tumbleweed-waiting-for-phy-auto-negotiation.jpg' %}

And reboots. The [GRUB] menu is not displayed.

I faced this problem while trying to boot the latest Tumbleweed [XFCE] image, based on snapshot 20201214. It does not happen with the latest Leap 15.2 XFCE image.

I asked for help on the [openSUSE ARM mailing list][opensuse-arm-1] and people pointed me to a workaround.

If you are a Tumbleweed user trying to boot your Raspberry Pi 4/400 and you are facing this problem as well, while it does not get definitively solved, you can download the `u-boot.bin` file from [here][u-boot-1] or from [here][u-boot-2] (I mirrored it) and replace the one in your SD card's EFI partition.

Doing that, you should be able to boot Tumbleweed on your Raspberry Pi 4/400 again.

This is [a known bug][bugzilla] and the [openSUSE] team is working to solve it.
