The development cycle for Linux Kamarada 15.1 is coming to an end. The Linux Kamarada Project is pleased to announce the availability of the Release Candidate (RC) for the homonym Linux distribution, which is now available for [download].

The Linux Kamarada Project aims to spread and promote [Linux] as a robust, secure, versatile and easy to use operating system, suitable for everyday use be at home, at work or on the server. It started as a blog about [openSUSE], which is the Linux distribution I've been using for 7 years. Now the project offers its own Linux distribution, which brings much of the software presented on the blog pre-installed and ready for use.

The Kamarada Linux distribution is based on [openSUSE Leap][leap-15.1] and is intended for use on desktops at home and at work, in both private companies and government entities. It features the essential software selection for any Linux installation and a nice looking modern desktop.

It is not recommended to use Linux Kamarada on servers, although it is possible. openSUSE is better suited for that use case, because it offers a server configuration during installation, which is going to set up a server with just a small set of packages and a text mode interface.

## What is a release candidate?

A [**release candidate**][rc] (**RC**) is a software version that is almost ready to be released to the market as a stable product. This release may become the final release, unless significant bugs are detected. At this stage of development, all features planned at the beginning are already present and no new features are added.

A release candidate is also a kind of [beta] version. Therefore, bugs are expected. If you find a bug, please report it on the [Linux Kamarada Google group][google-group] or on [GitHub].

Of course, bugs can be found and fixed anytime, but the sooner the better!

## Where can I get Linux Kamarada?

The [Download] page has been updated with the download link for the 15.1 RC.
