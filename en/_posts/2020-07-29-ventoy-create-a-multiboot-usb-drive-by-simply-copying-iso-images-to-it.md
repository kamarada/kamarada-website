title: 'Ventoy: create a multiboot USB drive by simply copying ISO images to it'
---

Did you know that you can install [Windows] and [Linux] using the same USB stick, without having to format it twice? Also, you can use the same USB stick to test live images of many Linux distributions, without having to format it again and again. Indeed, there are several tools to create bootable USB drives (good ones include [Rufus] for Windows, [SUSE Studio Imagewriter][imagewriter] and **[dd]** for Linux), but none of them is easier to use than the fairly new Ventoy.

[Ventoy] is a [free software][free-sw] tool to create bootable USB drives with [ISO images][iso]. You format a USB drive and install Ventoy to it just once. Thereafter, you can simply copy some ISO files to the USB drive and boot from it. Ventoy presents a [GRUB] menu listing the ISO images present on the USB drive, from where you can choose which one to boot and start using it right away.

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-01.jpg" %}

Ventoy supports legacy [BIOS] and [UEFI] (with and without [secure boot][secure-boot]), [MBR] and [GPT] partition tables, which makes it kind of universal.

Commonly, tools to create bootable USB drives extract the ISO image contents to the drive, allowing just one ISO image to be used at a time. That way, you need to reformat the drive every time you want to boot another ISO image. Besides that, tools usually prevent the drive from being used for other purposes (it's not possible to copy other files). With Ventoy, you don't need to format the drive again and again: you can copy and delete ISO images as you wish. You can also copy other files to drive, so you can continue to use it for other purposes.

You can find Ventoy very handy if you work on formatting and repairing computers, or if you like to try out different Linux distros. I myself started using Ventoy on the recommendation of a friend. I have been using it to test [Linux Kamarada 15.2 Beta][kamarada-15.2-beta]. Ventoy was very useful for me last week, when I installed Windows and Linux on my new [SSD Kingston A400][kingston], which I received from warranty after the previous one suffered from the [SATAFIRM S11][kingston] bug.

The first release of Ventoy (1.0.0) was made available on [April 5th][ventoy-news]. The latest release (1.0.17) is just 4 days old, from [July 25th][ventoy-news]. For future reference, to write this text I use this version.

## What do I need to use Ventoy?

To use Ventoy, you need a USB drive (be it a USB stick, an external hard drive, a memory card, etc.) that is large enough to hold the ISO images you are going to use. For instance, the [Linux Kamarada 15.1 ISO image][kamarada-15.1-iso] is 1.5GB. If you are going to use just that image, you need at least a 2GB drive. The [Windows 10 version 2004 ISO image][windows-10-iso] is 4.9GB. To use both images, you need at least an 8GB drive, and so on.

In addition, you need a Windows or Linux [PC] to prepare the USB drive.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    <p>Before proceeding, please note that the USB drive will be formatted by Ventoy, so <strong>the data on the USB drive will be lost</strong>! If you want to keep the data on it, here's what you can do: copy the data to another location (e.g. to the computer), install Ventoy on the USB drive, then move the data back to the USB drive.</p>
    <p>It is also recommended that you remove any other storage devices connected to your computer (such as other USB sticks, external hard drives, memory cards, etc.) to prevent them from being formatted by mistake.</p>
</div>

No more talking, let's see how to install and use this powerful tool!

## How to install Ventoy to the USB drive

Start by downloading Ventoy for your operating system from the Ventoy releases page on GitHub:
Â 
- [https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases)

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-02.png" %}

Below are instructions on how to install Ventoy to the USB drive depending on the operating system you use.

### How to install Ventoy using Windows

Download the `.zip` file corresponding to Ventoy for Windows.

When the download is complete, extract the contents of the archive. To do this, you can use the wizard that comes with Windows itself or a program such as [7-Zip]:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-windows-01-en.jpg" %}

Enter the extracted folder and launch the **Ventoy2Disk** executable by double-clicking it:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-windows-02-en.jpg" %}

Optionally, you can translate the Ventoy interface to your language by opening the **Language** menu and selecting the desired language:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-windows-03.jpg" %}

To this tutorial, I'm going to stay with the default language, which is **English (English)**.

Select the USB drive from the **Device** list and click **Install**:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-windows-04-en.jpg" %}

Ventoy warns you of the risk of data loss (what I said before). Click **Yes**:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-windows-05-en.jpg" %}

Double check you are formatting the right device and click **Yes**:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-windows-06-en.jpg" %}

After a few seconds or minutes, Ventoy finishes installing itself to the USB drive:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-windows-07-en.jpg" %}

You can click **OK** to dismiss that dialog box and close the Ventoy window. Before closing, observe that the program now informs you which Ventoy version is installed on the device:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-windows-08-en.jpg" %}

Now that your USB drive is ready, copy the ISO images you are going to use onto it:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-windows-09-en.jpg" %}

Note that you can organize them inside a folder, to keep them separated from other files on the USB drive. During boot, Ventoy searches all the directories and subdirectories recursively to find all the ISO files inside the USB drive.

### How to install Ventoy using Linux

To show how to install Ventoy using Linux, I'm going to use [Linux Kamarada 15.1][kamarada-15.1].

Download the `.tar.gz` file corresponding to Ventoy for Linux.

When the download is complete, extract the contents of the archive:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-linux-01-en.jpg" %}

Enter the extracted folder and you will find the `Ventoy2Disk.sh` script:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-linux-02-en.jpg" %}

Open a terminal window from within this folder.

Before proceeding, you need to find out the device name of your USB drive. To do this, you can use the **Disks** app:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-linux-03-en.jpg" %}

Or the **[fdisk]** command line utility:

```
# fdisk -l

[...]

Disk /dev/sdb: 7.2 GiB, 7744782336 bytes, 15126528 sectors
Disk model: USB DISK 2.0    
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x789ef007

Device     Boot Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/sdb1        2048 15126527 15124480  7.2G  b W95 FAT32
```

In my case, the USB drive name is `/dev/sdb`.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    <p>Be sure to correctly identify the USB drive, as well as correctly type its name next, so as not to format another device by mistake.</p>
</div>

We are ready to install Ventoy to the USB drive. Run the `Ventoy2Disk.sh` script as the administrator user (root), informing the device name as argument:

```
# sh Ventoy2Disk.sh -i /dev/sdb

***********************************************************
*                Ventoy2Disk Script                       *
*             longpanda  admin@ventoy.net                 *
***********************************************************

Disk : /dev/sdb
Modelo:  USB DISK 2.0 (scsi)
Size : 7 GB
Style: MBR


Attention:
You will install Ventoy to /dev/sdb.
All the data on the disk /dev/sdb will be lost!!!

Continue? (y/n)
```

Ventoy warns you of the risk of data loss and asks if you want to continue.

Type `y` (from _yes_) and then hit **Enter**:

```
Continue? (y/n)y

All the data on the disk /dev/sdb will be lost!!!
Double-check. Continue? (y/n)
```

Ventoy warns you once more (think twice). Again, type `y` and hit **Enter**:

```
Double-check. Continue? (y/n)y

rm: cannot remove './tmp_mnt': Device or resource busy

Install Ventoy to /dev/sdb successfully finished.
```

After a few seconds or minutes, Ventoy finishes installing itself to the USB drive.

Using Linux Kamarada 15.1, an error message was displayed, as you can see above. This is because Ventoy formats the USB drive with the [exFAT] file system, and support for that file system is not installed out-of-the-box on Linux Kamarada 15.1.

In case you see that error message on Linux Kamarada 15.1, [openSUSE Leap][leap], or another Linux distribution based on [openSUSE], install the exFAT support with:

```
# zypper in fuse-exfat
```

Linux Kamarada 15.2 will come with native support for the exFAT file system.

Now that your USB drive is ready, copy the ISO images you are going to use onto it:

{% include image.html src="/files/2020/07/ventoy-linux-04-en.jpg" %}

Note that you can organize them inside a folder, to keep them separated from other files on the USB drive. During boot, Ventoy searches all the directories and subdirectories recursively to find all the ISO files inside the USB drive.

## Using the USB drive with Ventoy

After installing Ventoy to the USB drive and copying ISO images onto it, it's time to use it: reboot your computer with the USB drive plugged in. Ventoy will list the ISO images on the USB drive in a menu, similar to the one presented on the first photo in this text. Select the desired ISO image and hit **Enter** to boot the system it contains.
